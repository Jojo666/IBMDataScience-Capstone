    "Chinatowns are cities within cities: adventurous, bustling, full of distinctive signage, street vendors selling unusual items, specialty shops, a noted lack of big chains, a variety of dialects being spoken, and multitudes of unique and exciting food choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinese have been established in the United States since the mid-19th century, when laborers were needed for gold mining and railroad work, but the immigrant population also grew during the 1990s and 2000s; in fact, more than one-third of the Chinese immigrants now living in the U.S. arrived in 2000 or later. Currently, there are more than 3 million Chinese in America, according to the 2008 census report. Whether leaving China for issues ranging from poverty, famine or political reasons, across the decades, the Chinese have built strong communities that keep their ethnic heritage and shared identity; this maintained and rich culture is a defining reason that Chinatowns endure and why they're so appealing for residents and tourists alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around the globe, there are Chinatowns in many major cities, from London (Europe's largest) to Vancouver (Canada's largest), Melbourne to Manila; and fortunately for us, there are many within the United States.Many of these districts share their community with other immigrant cultures, making the sights, sounds and eating choices that much more exotic. In a neighborhood where English is not the primary language, a visitor can feel as though they've left the U.S. altogether â€” and now they are the foreigner, a tourist in their own city. \n",
